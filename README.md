# Gesture Controlled RC Car

Everyone loves a RC car. But, let me tell you, itâ€™s not always necessary to have a conventional Remote Controller to move the car. 

In this Project we explored the possibility of moving the car using gestures of hand. For this we used MPU 6050 which has an inbuilt three-axis accelerometer and a three-axis gyroscope. This MPU 6050 is used to sense the tilt in the hand and then relay back to Arduino the data which is transmitted to the car using an NRF module. The Arduino onboard of car processes the data received and sends signals to the motors. 

The exact DIY guide will be updated soon.
